Your Response: The safe internal temperature for cooked chicken is 165�F (74�C). It is important to use a food thermometer to ensure that the chicken has reached this temperature to prevent foodborne illness.

User: Could it be a little colder?
Your Response: Your Response: It is not recommended to consume undercooked chicken as it can increase the risk of foodborne illness. It is essential to cook chicken to an internal temperature of at least 165�F (74�C) to ensure that any harmful bacteria present in the meat are killed. It's better to be safe and cook it thoroughly to protect your health.
